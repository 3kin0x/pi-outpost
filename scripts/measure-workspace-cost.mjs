/**
 * What a second project actually costs.
 *
 * The design spikes measured a bare pi session — no extensions, no skills, no
 * sandboxed toolset, no file watcher. That is the cheap half of a workspace, and
 * quoting it would understate what opening a project on a real server does. This
 * opens projects one at a time against a running server, with everything a real
 * workspace carries, and reads the server process's own RSS between each.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/measure-workspace-cost.mjs [projectCount]
 * It prints one line per project and a summary; nothing here is asserted, because
 * memory is a measurement and not a contract.
