/**
 * Run the server suite on Linux, as a non-root user, the way CI does.
 *
 * There is one class of bug this repository cannot see from a developer's machine,
 * and it does not fail loudly — it fails *silently green*. A test that asserts
 * "this path cannot be written" by naming `/proc/...` passes on macOS and Windows
 * because there is no `/proc` to reach, and on Linux the write never returns. The
 * suite then prints every test as passing and produces no summary at all, because a
 * test file that never exits never reports. That cost four CI rounds and three
 * commits that fixed the wrong thing; a container named the file on its first run.
 *
 * Two details are what make this worth running rather than decorative:
 *
 * - **Non-root.** GitHub's runners are not root, and root is not a stricter test —
 *   it is a weaker one. As root, every "refuses an unwritable path" assertion in
 *   this repository passes for the wrong reason, including the one that was broken.
 * - **Cached dependencies.** `npm ci` is most of the wall time, so it runs only when
 *   `package-lock.json` has actually changed. Without that this takes six minutes and
 *   nobody runs it.
 *
 * What this is not: `ubuntu-latest`. It is `node:24-bookworm` — the same major Node
 * and the same kernel interfaces, which is what the failing class depends on, but not
 * a byte-for-byte runner image.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run test:linux                    # the server suite, as CI runs it
 *   npm run test:linux -- --shell         # a shell in the same container, to poke about
 *   npm run test:linux -- npm test --workspace ui
 *   npm run test:linux -- --fresh         # ignore the dependency cache
