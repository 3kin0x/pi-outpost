/**
 * What the snapshot says is answering prompts.
 *
 * One line in the settings panel, and the only place an operator learns which SDK is
 * actually running. It used to read `pi SDK: dev` for every server not built into an
 * executable — which is most of them while anyone is working on this — because the
 * version was a bundle-time substitution with a literal fallback. These drive real
 * servers and read the field off the wire, in both shapes it can take.
