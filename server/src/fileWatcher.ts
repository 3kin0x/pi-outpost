/**
 * Directory watching for the file browser.
 *
 * The tree used to learn about a change only when this process was the one that
 * made it, and only through the `edit` and `write` tools — so a `bash` move, an
 * extension's write, or anything done outside the process at all left the tree
 * showing a workspace that no longer existed. This watches the disk instead.
 *
 * What is watched is exactly what a client has listed: `handleListDirectory` is
 * the one funnel every displayed directory passes through, so registering there
 * bounds the watch set by what somebody actually expanded. A collapsed directory
 * displays nothing, so nothing needs to know it changed — and a workspace with a
 * 40 000-directory `node_modules` costs nothing until someone opens it. This is
 * the whole reason there is no recursive watch on the root: on Linux that is one
 * inotify watch per subdirectory, which spends the host's `max_user_watches` on
 * directories nobody is looking at and then fails wholesale with ENOSPC.
 *
 * SECURITY: a watch is an open handle on a path. Every path resolves through the
 * file browser's own symlink-safe confinement before one is opened — the callers
 * have already confined it, but a second implementation of that rule is exactly
 * the kind that drifts, and this one would drift into which paths the server
 * holds handles on.
