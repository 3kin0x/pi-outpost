/**
 * Which theme wins, and why it matters who is asking.
 *
 * The rank that this file is really about: a host application names a theme on
 * every `mount()`, and a value this browser remembered from some earlier visit
 * was silently beating it. In a page that asked for light, a single past click
 * on ☾ left the widget dark for good, with nothing the host could do about it.
