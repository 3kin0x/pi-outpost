/**
 * A document edited beside its rendering.
 *
 * The claim under test is not "two panes appear". It is that the picture is of the
 * text in the editor — including text nobody has saved — and that it survives the
 * state that text spends most of its time in while someone types, which is
 * unparseable. A diagram that vanishes on every keystroke is worse than one that
 * is briefly out of date, so what is asserted is the rendering *staying*, not an
 * error being absent.
