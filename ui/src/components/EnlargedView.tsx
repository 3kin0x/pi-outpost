/**
 * Where an overlay is rendered.
 *
 * `position: fixed` and a z-index are only as absolute as the nearest ancestor
 * that made a stacking context, and a diagram lives deep inside the transcript.
 * The composer and the toolbar are in other branches with contexts of their own,
 * so they painted over an overlay that was nominally above them — leaving
 * controls visible and clickable through a dialog that had claimed the screen.
 * Hence a portal, out to the top of the tree.
 *
 * Which top depends on where the app is mounted. Embedded, it lives in a Shadow
 * DOM whose stylesheet is adopted by the shadow root (embed/src/mount.tsx), and
 * the document body is on the wrong side of that boundary: a node portalled
 * there gets no styling at all. Measured in the widget, the overlay came out
 * `position: static`, `z-index: auto`, transparent, and stacked *below* the
 * widget — half of it off-screen.
 *
 * Far enough out, then, but no further: the app's own root element, not the
 * shadow root above it. Inherited properties cross a shadow boundary — they are
 * not blocked, only overridden by whatever the tree declares for itself — and
 * what the app declares, it declares on that root. An overlay portalled past it
 * is a sibling, so it inherits from the *host element* instead, and a host page
 * that paints `* { color: red }` paints the widget's dialog red. Diagrams hid
 * this for a while: SVG text carries an explicit `fill` and inherits nothing. A
 * table is HTML text, and came out red on every cell.
 *
 * The root element is found by climbing rather than by id, so it is whatever the
 * app was actually mounted into. It creates no containing block, so `fixed`
 * still resolves against the viewport, and it is still above every stacking
 * context inside the app — which is what the portal was for.
 *
 * `anchor` is any element inside the app; the tree it belongs to decides.
 * Answering `undefined` for an anchor that is not mounted matters: the caller
 * remembers the last real answer rather than falling back to the document, and
 * falling back is the bug.
