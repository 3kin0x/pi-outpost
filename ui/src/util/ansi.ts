 * ANSI SGR sequences, turned into something a browser can show.

 * Extensions render their widgets and statuses for a terminal, and pi hands that
 * text to any front end unchanged — `ctx.mode` is "rpc" but the styling has
 * already happened. So a widget from little-coder arrives as
 * `ESC[38;2;225;90;31m◆ESC[39m ESC[1mextensionsESC[22m`, and a monospace
 * block that prints its input verbatim shows exactly that.
 *
 * Interpreting the codes rather than deleting them keeps what the extension author
 * meant: the colour separates a heading from a count, and dropping it flattens the
 * widget into an undifferentiated wall. Anything not understood is dropped rather
 * than printed — a stray escape is never content.
